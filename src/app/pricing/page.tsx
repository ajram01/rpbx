            <Accordion title="How does the Business Owner 30-day free trial work?">
              <p>
                You’ll have full access to the Business Owner membership for 30 days at no cost. During the trial, some features are limited — you won’t be able to view investors’ full profiles, filter or sort the investor listings, see your own business listing views, access the business valuation discount, or boost your listing. After the 30 days, your regular plan charges will automatically begin unless you cancel beforehand.
